<h4>THE GAZING GLOBE </h4>
    <h4>_Eugene Pillot_</h4>     
    <p>_ 
        
        OHANO. Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
        to gain the way to my heart's desire--and they've all failed me. The
        story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
        myth--but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
        at it in vain.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
        way to destruction!
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
        keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
        if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
        lover has been away so long----
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. But to-day he be coming back--I came to tell you I think I saw his
        boat----
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Nijo's boat? Where?
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. It be near the edge of the island just where----
        <br> 
        <br>
        OHANO. Why didn't you tell me before?
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. I came to--but I be forgetting when I see you at that evil ball
        again.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        OHANO. [_All eagerness._] Perhaps we can see him land--from here on the
        rocks--come, Zama, I hear the sound of voices down near the sea--come!
        [_They climb to the highest rock._] Look, Zama, the boat is there!
        Already there in the green water against the shore!
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. It do seem to be so. [_Peers toward right._
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. And _there_--is Nijo!
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. Where, where, child?
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. There--see, he's just coming ashore--oh, Nijo! And look, Zama,
        look what the people crowding round him have done--look!
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. What? My poor eyes be yet uncertain. What do they be doing to your
        lover?
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. They have put upon him the Robe of Flame--to greet him with the
        highest honor of the island.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. So they be. The robe they say the gods themselves did wear when
        time did first begin. Nijo must come back a great warrior now--a great
        warrior!
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Oh, how wonderful to return from the wars like that! Zama, I want
        to--I _must_ go out into the world and do great things too, like Nijo.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. Nijo be coming back, child. That do be enough. Look, what is it
        that glitters so in the sun?
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Why, they are giving something to my red god--something that's
        long as a serpent moon--see, he holds it out in admiration, before him.
        Just what can it be?
