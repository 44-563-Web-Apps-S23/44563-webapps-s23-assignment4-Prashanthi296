        <br>
        <br>
        Eugene Pillot, one of the well-known contemporary writers of one-act
        plays, was born in Houston, Texas. He was educated in the New York
        School of Fine and Applied Arts, at the University of Texas, at Cornell
        University, and at Harvard University. While at Harvard, he participated
        in the activities of The 47 Workshop.

        Mr. Pillot's one-act plays are always characterized by excellent and
        well-sustained technic. Among his best-known one-act plays are _The
        Gazing Globe_, _Two Crooks and a Lady_, _Telephone Number One_ (a prize
        play), _Hunger_, and _My Lady Dreams_. Mr. Pillot's plays have been
        produced frequently in schools and Little Theatres of America.

        _The Gazing Globe_ originally appeared in _The Stratford Journal_, and
        was first produced by the Boston Community Players, February 26, 1920,
        with the following cast: ZAMA, Rosalie Manning; OHANO, Beulah Auerbach;
        and NIJO, Eugene Pillot. _The Gazing Globe_ has unusually sustained
        tone and dramatic suspense.

        THE GAZING GLOBE[F]
        <br>
        
        
             SCENE: _A soft cream-colored room, bare walled and unfurnished
             except for dull-blue grass mats on the floor and brilliant
             cushions. In the centre of rear wall is a great circular window
             with a dais before it, so that it may be used as a doorway. A
             gathered shade of soft blue silk covers the opening of the window._
        <br>
        <br>
        PLACE: _An island in a southern sea._
        <br>
        <br>
        TIME: _Not so long ago._
        <br>
        <br>
             [_The curtain rises on an empty stage._ ZAMA, _an old servant woman
             dressed in dull purples and grays, hurries in from the right. She
             stops at centre stage and glances about searchingly, then calls in
             a weazen voice._
             <br>
             <br>

        
        ZAMA. Ohano--Ohano! Where do you be, child?
        
             [_Listens, looks about, sees drawn shade at the rear, and sighs as
             she goes to it and starts to raise it._
        
             [_As the shade rolls out of sight we see through the open window a
             bit of quaint cliff garden that overlooks a sea of green. The rocks
             are higher on the left, near the window, where a purple-pink vine
             in full blossom has started to climb. At the right the rocks slope
             down to the sea. At centre, stone steps lead up to a slender stone
             pedestal that holds a gazing globe, now a brilliant gold in the
             late afternoon sunlight._ OHANO, _with hands clasped round the
             globe, is gazing at it. She is a woman of the early twenties,
             beautiful and gowned in a flowing kimono-like robe of green with
             embroideries of white and blue._
             <br>
             <br>

        
        ZAMA. [_In a chiding, motherly way._] Ohano, my child, you must not be
        so much at that evil ball! How many times be I not telling you it is an
        _enchanted_ ball?
        <br>
        <br>
        
        OHANO. Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
        to gain the way to my heart's desire--and they've all failed me. The
        story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
        myth--but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
        at it in vain.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
        way to destruction!
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
        keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
        if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
        lover has been away so long----
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. But to-day he be coming back--I came to tell you I think I saw his
        boat----
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Nijo's boat? Where?
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. It be near the edge of the island just where----
        <br> 
        <br>
        OHANO. Why didn't you tell me before?
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. I came to--but I be forgetting when I see you at that evil ball
        again.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        OHANO. [_All eagerness._] Perhaps we can see him land--from here on the
        rocks--come, Zama, I hear the sound of voices down near the sea--come!
        [_They climb to the highest rock._] Look, Zama, the boat is there!
        Already there in the green water against the shore!
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. It do seem to be so. [_Peers toward right._
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. And _there_--is Nijo!
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. Where, where, child?
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. There--see, he's just coming ashore--oh, Nijo! And look, Zama,
        look what the people crowding round him have done--look!
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. What? My poor eyes be yet uncertain. What do they be doing to your
        lover?
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. They have put upon him the Robe of Flame--to greet him with the
        highest honor of the island.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. So they be. The robe they say the gods themselves did wear when
        time did first begin. Nijo must come back a great warrior now--a great
        warrior!
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Oh, how wonderful to return from the wars like that! Zama, I want
        to--I _must_ go out into the world and do great things too, like Nijo.
        <br>
        <br>
        ZAMA. Nijo be coming back, child. That do be enough. Look, what is it
        that glitters so in the sun?
        <br>
        <br>
        OHANO. Why, they are giving something to my red god--something that's
        long as a serpent moon--see, he holds it out in admiration, before him.
        Just what can it be?
